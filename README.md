# Short term PM₂.₅ exposure and respiratory admissions

This project explores whether **short term spikes in PM₂.₅** are associated with
**deviations in daily respiratory hospital admissions**, compared with nearby
low-exposure days.

The analysis is **observational** and focuses on comparison against local
background patterns rather than causal inference.

High PM₂.₅ days are defined relative to regional context, and admissions data are
simulated to reflect realistic daily variability.

## What this analysis does
- Compares admissions on high-exposure days vs nearby comparison days
- Emphasises deviation from expected patterns
- Uses simple, transparent summaries and visuals

## What this analysis cannot prove
- Individual level exposure or causality
- Effects independent of other time-varying factors
- Long-term health impacts
